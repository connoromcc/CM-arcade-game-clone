# CM-arcade-game-clone

This will serve as my submission for Project 3 of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

Within, I aim to recreate the game displayed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be

I use provided materials to implement character movement and collision detection. 

Future Changes:
I intend to continue work on this project in hopes of implementing dynamic and visible player score and a player selection screen.
